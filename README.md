# FACIAL-RECOGNITION-AND-MATCHING-BASED-ON-EIGENVALUE
This project is to improve the face detection system by using Haar Classifier to get higher accuracy result. Haar Classifier is used for face detection because it can detect the desire image very fast. The algorithm has been used for the detection which achieved a higher detection accuracy.

# 1. Data Preprocessing
For the purpose of this project, a dataset of 40 people have been obtained. Each of these people has 10 images with different poses. That means in total there are 40 x 10 = 400 images. For every individual, there is separate folders. Explaining it in this way will create confusion.

In figure 1, we can see in the top row, there are 40 people marked as 1, 2, 3 to 40. Each of them has 10 images. These images are in grayscale. All of these images must have to be of same dimension and resolution. Finally, the images of every individuals are kept into separate folders. In the figure 1, the s1, s2, s3 â€¦.. s40 are representing the folders.
