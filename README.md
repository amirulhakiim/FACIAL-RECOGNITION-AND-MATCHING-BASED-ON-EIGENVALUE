# FACIAL-RECOGNITION-AND-MATCHING-BASED-ON-EIGENVALUE
This project is to improve the face detection system by using Haar Classifier to get higher accuracy result. Haar Classifier is used for face detection because it can detect the desire image very fast. The algorithm has been used for the detection which achieved high detection accuracy.
